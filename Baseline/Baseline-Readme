# Fast-URDMU: Optimizing Video Anomaly Detection

## Project Overview

The URDMU (Dual Memory Units with Uncertainty Regulation) model, introduced in AAAI 2023, represents a significant advancement in video anomaly detection. Our project builds upon the original URDMU implementation (cloned from the official repository at https://github.com/henrryzh1/UR-DMU/tree/master) which utilizes dual memory units to capture both normal and abnormal patterns in videos, regulated by an uncertainty mechanism through variational encoding. While the baseline URDMU achieves impressive results (AUC: 0.940, AP: 0.817 on XD-Violence), its computational demands during inference present opportunities for optimization. Our project aims to maintain URDMU's high detection accuracy while significantly reducing inference time through various optimization techniques. The goal is to make URDMU more practical for real-world applications where rapid anomaly detection is crucial.
