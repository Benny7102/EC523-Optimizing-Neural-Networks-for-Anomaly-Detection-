# EC523 - Anomaly Detection Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing the BatchNorm-based Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (BN-WVAD) model for real-time crime detection in video footage, with an emphasis on improving computational efficiency while maintaining detection performance.

## Project Overview

We aim to enhance the BN-WVAD model through two main optimization approaches:
- **Pruning**: Implementing the lottery ticket hypothesis to identify efficient subnetworks
- **Quantization**: Applying post-training quantization techniques to reduce model complexity

### Dataset
- UCF-Crime Dataset
- 1,900 untrimmed surveillance videos
- 1,610 training videos and 290 test videos
- Contains both normal and anomalous events

### Performance Metrics
- AUC (Area Under Curve)
- AP (Average Precision)
- AUC_sub/AP_sub for known anomalies
- Inference time (ms/frame or FPS)
